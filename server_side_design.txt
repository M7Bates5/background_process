SERVER SIDE LIVING DESIGN DOC

This document serves as a log of the current design concepts for the server side application(s) and a repository for ideas whether adopted or not.

Initial Thoughts:

Shalls:
take command line arguments.
be capable of recursive directory search.
capable of finding specified strings(tags) within the file system.
produce matches:
return as path/to/file?
store as array of paths/to/files and provide means of access?
